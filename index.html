    <p>
    I am a business administration student with a strong interest in FinTech. I’m currently learning the basics of coding, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to build skills for a future in technology and finance. I have experience in office administration and working with CRM systems. I’m motivated to learn, and focused on growing my knowledge to succeed in the FinTech industry.
